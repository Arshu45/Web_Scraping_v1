# Myer Retail Competitive Intelligence Platform

A production-grade, concurrent hybrid competitive intelligence system. The platform scrapes promotional offers directly from competitor websites, extracts text and visual banner offers, classifies them with an LLM, routes them into business team feeds via a configurable policy engine, deduplicates by source page, and stores clean promotion rows in PostgreSQL for dashboard review.

## System Architecture

```text
BRONZE LAYER — Dynamic browser scraping
  - Parallel Playwright headless scraping via config/targets/*.json
  - Text extraction from configured CSS selectors
  - Screenshot/image extraction for banner-like promotional elements
  - Vision LLM extraction for image-based offers

        ↓

SILVER LAYER — PostgreSQL storage
  - LLM category assignment from env-driven category taxonomy
  - URL-aware deduplication: source + brand + source_url + offer_title
  - Stores offer title, category, brand, source URL, confidence, timestamps

        ↓

ROUTING LAYER — Team Policy Engine
  - config/teams.json defines which categories and brands route to which team
  - TeamPolicyEngine evaluates each promotion and writes to promotion_team_assignments
  - Supports allowlists, denylists, regional suffix normalisation

        ↓

GOLD LAYER — Streamlit Dashboard
  - Team-wise and category-wise promotional feeds
  - Weekly competitor matrix by team, brand, and day of week
  - Filters by team, category, brand, date, and extraction source
```

## Extraction Approach

The scraper uses a hybrid extraction strategy:

- **Text extraction** collects visible promotional text from configured CSS selectors.
- **Screenshot/image extraction** captures banner-like page elements and sends them to the configured vision LLM.
- **LLM category classification** runs once per brand scrape as a batched text call. It assigns each extracted offer to one category from the environment-driven taxonomy.
- **URL-aware deduplication** keeps identical promo text separate when it appears on different pages, such as `/men/` and `/kids/`.

> If a target config defines **no** `text_selectors` and no `screenshot_selectors`, the extractor skips that phase entirely. No fallback selectors are used.

Categories are configured in `.env`:

```env
PROMO_CATEGORIES="Home, Entertainment, Womens, Beauty, Kids, Toys, Menswear, Footwear, Others"
```

---

## Team Routing

Business team routing is controlled by `config/teams.json`. This is completely separate from scraping — it is applied after promotions are stored in the database.

### How it works

1. Each promotion has an LLM-assigned `category` and a `brand`.
2. `TeamPolicyEngine` reads `teams.json` and evaluates each promotion against:
   - **`categories`** — the promotion's category must match one in the team's list.
   - **`allowed_brands`** — if specified, the promotion's brand must be in this list.
   - **`excluded_brands`** — if specified, the promotion's brand must NOT be in this list.
3. Matching team IDs are written to the `promotion_team_assignments` table.
4. A promotion can belong to multiple teams.

### Example `config/teams.json` entry

```json
{
  "Menswear": {
    "team_id": "menswear_team",
    "categories": ["Menswear", "Others"],
    "allowed_brands": [
      "Tommy Hilfiger", "Calvin Klein", "Gazman", "ASOS", "Superdry"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Current team configuration

| Team | Team ID | Categories |
|---|---|---|
| Womens (WIFA) | `womens_wifa` | Womens |
| Kids & Toys | `kids_toys_team` | Kids, Toys |
| Toys | `toys_team` | Toys |
| Menswear | `menswear_team` | Menswear, Others |
| Entertainment | `entertainment_team` | Entertainment |
| Beauty | `beauty_team` | Beauty |
| Home | `home_team` | Home |

### Updating team rules (no re-scrape needed)

After editing `config/teams.json`, re-apply routing to all existing promotions:

```bash
python scripts/reassign_teams.py
```

This re-evaluates and updates `promotion_team_assignments` for all 
existing promotions in the database without scraping anything.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/promo_db_v3

# LiteLLM / corporate gateway
LLM_PROVIDER=litellm
LITELLM_API_KEY=your_litellm_key
LITELLM_API_BASE=https://your-litellm-gateway.example/v1
VISION_LLM_MODEL=claude-haiku-4.5

# Direct Gemini fallback
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Category taxonomy used by the LLM classifier
PROMO_CATEGORIES="Home, Entertainment, Womens, Beauty, Kids, Toys, Menswear, Footwear, Others"

MAX_CONCURRENT_BROWSERS=3
VISION_API_MIN_DELAY=1.0

# Cost estimate rate for Vision API calls (order-of-magnitude, not billing-accurate)
VISION_COST_PER_MILLION_TOKENS_USD=1.00

# Dashboard rolling window (days of history to load on startup)
DASHBOARD_LOOKBACK_DAYS=90
```

### 3. Initialize the Database

```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

Creates all tables (`competitors`, `promotions`, `promotion_team_assignments`) if they don't exist.

### 4. Run the Scraper

Run all enabled targets via Prefect:

```bash
python flows/master_pipeline.py
```

Run a single target for testing:

```bash
python scripts/run_hybrid_promo_scraper.py --target config/targets/the_iconic.json
```

### 5. Apply Team Routing

Team assignments are applied automatically after each scrape. To manually re-apply after editing `teams.json`:

```bash
python scripts/reassign_teams.py
```

### 6. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Target Configuration

Each file in `config/targets/` controls how a brand is scraped.

```json
{
  "brand": "The Iconic",
  "source_url": [
    "https://www.theiconic.com.au/men/",
    "https://www.theiconic.com.au/kids/"
  ],
  "spider": "image_promo",
  "extraction_strategy": "hybrid",
  "text_selectors": [".discover-more-content b"],
  "screenshot_selectors": ["[class*='Banner']"],
  "min_image_width": 400,
  "min_image_height": 150,
  "min_aspect_ratio": 1.2,
  "exclude_url_patterns": ["/logo", "/icon", "/avatar", "social", "payment"],
  "request_delay_seconds": 3,
  "scroll_depth": 3,
  "enabled": false
}
```

`source_url` may be a single string or a list. If both `text_selectors` and `screenshot_selectors` are empty lists, the target is skipped — no fallback selectors are used.

---

## Deduplication

Promotions are fingerprinted using:

```text
SHA-256(source_name + brand + source_url + offer_title + scraped_date)
```

Identical offer text on different pages (e.g. `/men/` vs `/kids/`) is stored as separate rows.
The date component ensures the same offer is re-recorded daily for timeline tracking.

---

## LLM Cost Tracking

Each scrape reports cumulative API cost. The estimate uses the model configured via `VISION_LLM_MODEL` (default: Gemini 2.5 Flash for direct, or any model via LiteLLM gateway):

```text
USD per 1M input tokens (configurable via VISION_COST_PER_MILLION_TOKENS_USD, default 1.00)
image_tokens ≈ (width × height / 800) + 170
text_tokens  ≈ characters / 4
```

This is an order-of-magnitude estimate, not a billing-accurate figure.

---

## Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard at `http://localhost:8501` provides:

- **Feed Metrics** — total promotions, active brands, and offers scraped today
- **Promotions by Brand** — horizontal bar chart
- **Extraction Timeline** — daily scrape volume line chart
- **Weekly Competitor Matrix (Team View)** — per-team pivot of brands × weekday with offer titles
- **Extracted Promotions Table** — filterable table with brand, assigned team feeds, AI category, source, offer title, URL, confidence, and timestamp
- **Excel Export** — download the weekly matrix as a formatted `.xlsx` file

### Sidebar Filters

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| Select Business Teams | Multi-select by team (Menswear, Beauty, Home, etc.) |
| Select Categories | Multi-select by LLM-assigned category |
| Select Brands | Multi-select by competitor brand |
| Start / End Date | Date range for scraped_at |
| Select Extraction Sources | Filter by `text_scraper` or `image_promo` |

Promotions not assigned to any team appear under **Unassigned / General**.
